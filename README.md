📚 Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying and modeling second-order dynamic systems using experimental data and resonance analysis. Both non-parametric and parametric methods are used for system identification and validation.

⚙️ Objectives
    Identify second-order systems (with and without zeros)

    Analyze resonance to extract key parameters

    Estimate frequency response using Bode plots

    Apply ARMAX and OE models for parametric identification

    Validate models using statistical tests

🛠 Methods Used
Non-parametric identification based on resonance

ARMAX and OE modeling

Frequency response estimation

Model validation via autocorrelation and error analysis

📈 Tools & Technologies
MATLAB for analysis, modeling, and validation

CSV data processing and signal visualization

✅ Results
Successfully identified transfer functions

Resonance parameters (damping, natural frequency, etc.) extracted

Frequency response validated through Bode plots

Parametric models achieved over 96% fit
