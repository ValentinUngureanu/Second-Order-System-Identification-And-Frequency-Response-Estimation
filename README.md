# Second-Order System Identification & Frequency Response Analysis

## 📚 Project Overview
This repository contains a complete project focused on the identification and modeling of second-order dynamic systems, based on experimental data and resonance analysis.
The project includes both non-parametric and parametric identification methods, frequency response estimation, and validation procedures.

## ⚙️ Key Objectives
- Identification of a second-order system (with and without zeros) using data from experimental measurements.
- Analysis of the resonance phenomenon to determine key parameters (resonance frequency, amplitude ratio, proportionality factor, damping factor, and natural pulsation).
- Estimation of the system's frequency response (Bode plot analysis for magnitude and phase characteristics).
- Parametric identification using ARMAX and Output-Error (OE) models.
- Validation of the identified models using autocorrelation and intercorrelation tests.

## 🛠 Methodologies Used
- **Non-parametric identification** based on resonance analysis.
- **Parametric identification** using:
  - ARMAX (AutoRegressive Moving Average with eXogenous input) models.
  - OE (Output Error) models.
- **Frequency response estimation** with computed Bode plots.
- Model validation through statistical tests and error analysis.

## 📈 Technologies & Tools
- MATLAB (Data analysis, system identification, frequency response estimation, validation)
- CSV data processing and signal visualization


## ✅ Key Results
- Successfully identified transfer functions for second-order systems.
- Resonance-based damping factor, natural frequency, and proportionality factor determined.
- Frequency response estimated and validated through Bode plots.
- Parametric models validated with a fit of over 96%.
